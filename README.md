# SpeedyMeet
Chrome Extension to automatically open Google Meet links in the Google Meet PWA

## Installation
Download this repo, and load as an Unpacked Extension in chrome://extensions

## Usage
Once the Extension is installed, open the Google Meet PWA and then open a Google Meet link. You should see the Meet link open in a Tab and then get moved over to the PWA automatically.

## Notes
Currently it won't do anything if the PWA is not already open.
